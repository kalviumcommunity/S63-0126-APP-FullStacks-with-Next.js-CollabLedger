# CollabLedger

CollabLedger is a centralized platform designed to streamline collaboration between NGOs and open-source contributors. By providing visibility into ongoing projects and contribution pipelines, it aims to eliminate redundant efforts and maximize the impact of social good initiatives.

## Problem Statement

NGOs and open-source contributors often work in silos, leading to significant duplication of work. Without a clear view of existing projects or active contribution pipelines, valuable resources are wasted on solving problems that have already been addressed elsewhere. CollabLedger solves this by providing a transparent, unified dashboard for project tracking and collaboration.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js `src/` directory structure to ensure clean separation of concerns:

- `src/app/`: Contains the App Router pages, layouts, and API routes. This is the core of the application's routing logic.
- `src/components/`: Dedicated to reusable UI components (e.g., Headers, Buttons, Modals, Cards). This promotes the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
- `src/lib/`: Holds utility functions, shared configurations, and third-party library initializations (e.g., Prisma client, configuration helpers).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CollabLedger
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Reflection

### Why this folder structure was chosen?
The `src/` directory structure with segregated `app`, `components`, and `lib` folders was chosen to align with industry best practices for Next.js applications. It keeps the root directory clean and provides a clear map of where different types of code should reside.

### How it supports scalability and collaboration?
- **Scalability**: By separating UI components from page logic and utility functions, the codebase remains manageable as it grows. New features can be added by creating new routes in `app/` and reusing existing components from `components/`.
- **Collaboration**: A standardized structure reduces the cognitive load for new contributors. Team members can easily locate files, reducing the friction often found in large-scale collaborative projects.

### TypeScript & ESLint Configuration

#### Why strict TypeScript mode reduces runtime bugs?
Enabling strict mode in TypeScript (e.g., `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`) ensures that the compiler catches potential errors at development time rather than runtime. It forces developers to handle null/undefined cases and ensures type safety across the application, significantly reducing "undefined is not a function" errors.

#### What our chosen ESLint + Prettier rules enforce?
- **Prettier**: Enforces consistent code formatting (double quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation), which makes the codebase easier to read and reduces git diff noise from formatting changes.
- **ESLint**: Enforces code quality rules, such as warning against `console.log` and ensuring semicolons and quotes are used consistently.

#### How pre-commit hooks improve team consistency?
Using Husky and `lint-staged`, we ensure that every piece of code committed to the repository is automatically linted and formatted. This prevents "broken" or poorly formatted code from entering the main codebase, maintaining a high standard of quality across the entire team without manual intervention.
