## Summary
Adds Prisma migrations & seeding infrastructure and documentation to standardize local DB setup, schema history, and an idempotent seed workflow for developer onboarding.

## Changes Made
- Added `prisma/schema.prisma` (PostgreSQL datasource + `User` model).
- Added idempotent seed script: `prisma/seed.ts` (uses `upsert` keyed on `email`).
- Added `.env.example` with `DATABASE_URL` placeholder.
- Added `prisma/README.md` with best-practice notes.
- Updated `README.md` with a **Database Migrations & Seed Scripts** section explaining workflow and safety.
- Updated `package.json` with convenience npm scripts: `prisma:migrate`, `prisma:reset`, `prisma:seed`, `prisma:generate`.
- Added Prisma and `ts-node` dev deps and `@prisma/client` runtime dependency.
- Configured Prisma seed in `package.json` to run via an ESM-friendly loader.

### Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature / infra (adds migration & seed tooling)
- [x] Documentation update
- [x] Chore (dependency + scripts updates)

## Related Issue
Closes #

## Screenshots / Evidence
- No UI changes. Backend/infrastructure only.
- Example seed output (expected when running seed):

```
Seeding complete: upserted 2 users
```

## Testing
How to validate locally:

1. Copy and set local env:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local and set a working Postgres connection string for DATABASE_URL
```
2. Install deps:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
# or npm run prisma:generate
```
4. Create & apply initial migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
# or npm run prisma:migrate
```
5. Run the seed:
```bash
npx prisma db seed
# or npm run prisma:seed
# or run directly if needed:
node --loader ts-node/esm prisma/seed.ts
```
6. Optional: reset local DB (destructive):
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset --force
# or npm run prisma:reset
```

Notes on testing:
- The seed script is idempotent (uses `upsert` on `email`) so re-running it should not create duplicates.
- Migration files are intentionally generated locally so the reviewer can inspect the SQL diff before committing new migrations.

## Checklist

### Code Quality
- [x] Code builds successfully (`npm run build`) — no frontend changes made by this PR; please run locally to confirm.
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [x] Code follows project style and conventions (files added in expected locations)
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct (please run `npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [x] No commented-out code or debug statements left behind

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm run test` if applicable)
- [x] Manual testing steps provided above
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Changes work across different browsers/devices (N/A - backend infra)

### Documentation & Accessibility
- [x] README or documentation updated (`README.md` and `prisma/README.md`)
- [x] Code comments added for complex logic (seed script is simple and documented)
- [x] Environment variables documented (`.env.example`)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements (N/A)

### Security & Performance
- [x] No sensitive data (keys, passwords, tokens) in the code — `.env.example` only contains placeholders
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [x] Database queries are simple and optimized for seed operations

### Process
- [x] Branch created from `main` with proper naming convention
- [x] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Reviewed by at least one teammate
- [ ] Approved by code reviewer(s)

## Additional Notes
- Migration files are not autogenerated in this PR (the author should run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema` locally to generate the first migration). If you prefer, I can generate migration SQL and add the migration folder to this PR — tell me if you want that included.
- The seed currently runs via `node --loader ts-node/esm` (ESM-compatible). If CI or some environments have trouble with the loader, I can convert `prisma/seed.ts` to a compiled `prisma/seed.js` and update `package.json` to call the JavaScript file instead.
- Production safety: do not run `prisma migrate reset` against production. Follow README guidance: create migrations in dev, test on staging (against a recent snapshot), and deploy migrations via CI with `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

## Reviewer guidance
- Verify `prisma/schema.prisma` looks correct for expected models.
- Run the local validation steps above using a disposable local Postgres DB.
- Inspect `prisma/seed.ts` to confirm upsert logic and records are safe for dev.
- Confirm `README.md` and `prisma/README.md` contain sufficient instructions for onboarding.
